# Multi-Agent SEO Blog Generator
This project is a Python-based multi-agent system designed to generate a high-quality, SEO-optimized blog post (approximately 2000 words) on a trending HR-related topic. The system comprises multiple specialized agents that work in sequence to research, plan, generate, optimize, and review the content.

## System Architecture

The system follows a modular multi-agent architecture with five specialized components:

        A[Research Agent] --> B[Content Planning Agent]
        B --> C[Content Generation Agent]
        C --> D[SEO Optimization Agent]
        D --> E[Review Agent]


## Agent Workflow

1. **Research Agent:**
   - Searches for trending HR topics using web scraping and/or APIs (e.g., Google Trends).
   - Summarizes key trends, statistics, and relevant insights.

2. **Content Planning Agent:**
   - Receives the research summary.
   - Creates a structured outline including sections, headings, and key points.

3. **Content Generation Agent:**
   - Uses the outline as a prompt.
   - Generates the blog content using an LLM (e.g., OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4).

4. **SEO Optimization Agent:**
   - Reviews the draft for SEO elements.
   - Adjusts keyword usage, meta descriptions, and readability.

5. **Review Agent:**
   - Proofreads the content.
   - Applies final editing and formatting tweaks.

6. **Final Export:**
   - Saves the optimized blog post in the desired format (e.g., Markdown).
